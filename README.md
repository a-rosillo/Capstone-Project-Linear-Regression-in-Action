 ## Dataset Attributes

 The dataset contains information about houses in Ames, Iowa. The data was collected by the Ames City Assessorâ€™s Office describing 2930 property sales which occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The dataset, containing 81 variables, was compiled and published by De Cock in 2011.

 Some of the variables contained in the original dataset have been removed from the the dataset provided to you.
 The dataset provided to you contains the following variables:
* **Year_Built:** year that the house was originally constructed
* **Year_Remod_Add:** year that the house was last remodelled
* **Total_Bsmt_SF:** total size of basement area in square feet
* **First_Flr_SF:** size of the first floor in square feet
* **Second_Flr_SF:** size of the second floor in square feet
* **Gr_Liv_Area:** size of above grade, ground living area in square feet
* **Full_Bath:** number of full above grade bathrooms in the house
* **Half_Bath:** number of half above grade bathrooms in the house
* **Bedroom_AbvGr:** number of above grade bedrooms (does not include basement bedrooms)
* **Kitchen_AbvGr:** number of above grade kitchens
* **TotRms_AbvGrd:** total number of above grade rooms (does not include bathrooms)

 ## Objective

 The goal of this task is to analyse the relationship between these variables and build a multiple linear regression model to predict the sales prices based on the 'Gr_Liv_Area' and 'Garage_Area` variables.
